Technology Stack

Django: Python web framework used to build the backend RESTful APIs and application logic.

Graphene (GraphQL): Library for creating and serving GraphQL schemas and queries for flexible data retrieval.

MySQL: Relational database management system for storing user data, bookings, and listings.

Docker: Containerization platform to package the application and its dependencies for consistent development and production environments.

GitHub Actions: CI/CD tool to automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows on every push or pull request.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Token-based authentication mechanism for stateless user sessions.

OAuth2: Authorization protocol to securely manage user permissions and third-party access.

HTTPS: Encrypted transport layer to secure all HTTP traffic between client and server.
