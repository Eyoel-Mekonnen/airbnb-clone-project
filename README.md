Implement JWT/OAuth security for REST/GraphQL APIs

Configure CI/CD pipelines using Docker & GitHub Actions

Document and plan features with industry best practices

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Backend: Django, Graphene (GraphQL)

Database: MySQL

CI/CD: Docker, GitHub Actions

Security: JWT, OAuth2, HTTPS

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Python 3.9+ & pip

Docker & Docker Compose

Git & GitHub account

MySQL server

Database Design

Users:

Fields: id, name, email, password, created_at

Relations: A user can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

Properties:

Fields: id, owner_id (FK ‚Üí Users), title, description, price_per_night, created_at

Relations: A property belongs to one user (owner) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

Bookings:

Fields: id, user_id (FK ‚Üí Users), property_id (FK ‚Üí Properties), start_date, end_date, status

Relations: A booking belongs to one user and one property and may have one associated payment.

Reviews:

Fields: id, user_id (FK ‚Üí Users), property_id (FK ‚Üí Properties), rating, comment, created_at

Relations: A review is written by a user for a specific property.

Payments:

Fields: id, booking_id (FK ‚Üí Bookings), amount, payment_date, payment_method

Relations: A payment is linked to one booking.



üöÄ Setup & Run

git clone <repo-url> && cd airbnb-clone

Copy .env.example ‚Üí .env and configure credentials

docker-compose up --build

python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver

Technology Stack

Django: Python web framework used to build the backend RESTful APIs and application logic.

Graphene (GraphQL): Library for creating and serving GraphQL schemas and queries for flexible data retrieval.

MySQL: Relational database management system for storing user data, bookings, and listings.

Docker: Containerization platform to package the application and its dependencies for consistent development and production environments.

GitHub Actions: CI/CD tool to automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows on every push or pull request.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Token-based authentication mechanism for stateless user sessions.

OAuth2: Authorization protocol to securely manage user permissions and third-party access.

HTTPS: Encrypted transport layer to secure all HTTP traffic between client and server.


Feature Breakdown

User Management: Enables account registration, authentication, and profile management. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their personal settings, ensuring secure access control throughout the application.

Property Management: Allows property owners to create, update, and delete listings. Owners can specify details like title, description, pricing, and availability, ensuring accurate and appealing listings for potential guests.

Booking System: Facilitates seamless reservation of properties. Users select dates, review availability, and confirm bookings, while the system handles status updates and calendar management to avoid conflicts.

Review & Rating System: Collects feedback from users after each stay. Guests can submit ratings and comments, which are displayed to inform future travelers and maintain quality standards across listings.

Payment Processing: Integrates secure payment gateways to handle transactions. The system processes payments upon booking, tracks payment status, and issues receipts, ensuring reliable and transparent financial flows.
